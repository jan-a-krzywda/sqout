"""The measured OpenAlex behaviour that shaped connect.py.

A resolved preprint whose record carries no reference list is the common case,
not an edge case — see the module docstring in connect.py for the measurement.
These tests pin the distinction between "never found it" and "found it but it
told us nothing", because the two need different follow-up.
