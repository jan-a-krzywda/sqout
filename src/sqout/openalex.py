"""Minimal OpenAlex client — DOI batch resolution with references.

Origin note: the request shapes, the `select` field list, the 50-DOI batch
size, and the emitted record schema deliberately match SpinLib's
`scripts/oa_fetch.py`, so records produced here stay interchangeable with the
corpus's `works.json`. This is a re-implementation, not an import: sqout does
not depend on SpinLib at runtime. If OpenAlex changes its API shape, that file
is the other place worth looking.

Not carried over from oa_fetch.py: BibTeX parsing, the title-search fallback,
and its `main()`. Sqout derives DOIs from arXiv IDs directly, so it needs
neither — and `main()` carries a resume guard that skips newly added entries
once its cache is populated.
